# ChiralCaptcha
### An Android-based CAPTCHA Generator Demo

This project specializes in generating complex molecular structure images containing chiral carbon atoms for use as CAPTCHAs.

# Molecular Database
- Source: [PubChem Compound Database](https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubchem/Compound/CURRENT-Full/SDF)

Over 10,000 `.mol` files have been added to this database, providing a rich source of molecular structures for generating CAPTCHAs.
